ROS2 Planning System (**plansys2** in short) is a project whose objective is to provide Robotics developers with a reliable, simple, and efficient PDDL-based planning system. It is implemented in ROS2, applying the latest concepts developed in this currently de-facto standard in Robotics.

This project is the result of several years of experience in the development of robotic behaviors using [ROSPlan](https://github.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan). ROSPlan has greatly inspired this project. In addition to the migration to ROS2, we contribute to key aspects: ease of use, efficiency, and new tools, such as our terminal.

We hope that this software helps to include planning in more Robotics projects, offering simple and powerful software to generate intelligent behaviors for robots.

We want to invite you to contribute to this Open Source project !!
